This was the first website I developed with React.js. Since then I have developed a few more but have yet to put the code on GitHub.
The name GANArt comes from the fact that all the images on the website were generated with a machine learning algorithm knows as a generative adversarial network (GAN).

Disclaimer: I need to clean up and document this code. The quality of this code does not reflect my overall skillset as a programmer.

## To Left Field Labs:

Using GPT-3, I am also working on a website that generates fake product names, and subsequent descriptions for that product. Here are a couple example outputs I generated while filling out the application for the Junior to Mid-Level Front End Developer position.

  **Product Name:**
  Lite-Touch

  **Short Description:**
  Lite-Touch is a new kind of flat panel display that eliminates the need for a power cord.

  **Long Description:**
  Using groundbreaking technology, Lite-Touch displays are powered by indoor lighting and can be used in any environment. For example, using our patented “LightSwitch”  technology, Lite-Touch displays can be powered by the sun indoors or on a window sill. Plus, they do not require batteries or any other power source! Because there are no cords, you can easily move your board from room to room or even take it outside to use as an all weather display and bulletin board. The bottom line is that there has never been an easier way to display information so inexpensively!

  **Product Name:**
  Newton

  **Short Description:**
  Never lose your keys again! Newton is a Bluetooth key finder that pairs with your smartphone so you can find your keys from anywhere using the free app.

  **Long Description:**
  When you misplace something, there's no reason to delay for even a second – especially if it's important. The Newton is a Bluetooth key finder that pairs with your iPhone or Android so you can use the free app to find anything you've misplaced in seconds! It has an ultra-precise location system and works even if it is in another room or buried under junk mail! Simply attach the device to any keyring and download the free app – available for both Android and iPhone – on Google Play or Apple's App Store. You'll never have to worry about losing your keys, laptop, or purse again!
  
  
My long-term goal, to facilitate creativity with technology, has only just begun. As displayed here, I will bring the originality, insight, and technical skills essential for your business solutions.
