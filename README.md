# ganart-io

https://ganart-io.web.app/

This was the first website I developed with React.js. Since then I have developed a few more but have yet to put the code on GitHub.
The name GANArt comes from the fact that all the images on the website were generated with a machine learning algorithm knows as a generative adversarial network (GAN).
