This was the first website I developed with React.js. Since then I have developed a few more websites, but have yet to put the code on GitHub.
The name GANArt comes from the fact that all images on this website were generated with a machine learning algorithm known as a generative adversarial network (GAN).

## To Left Field Labs:

With the use of GPT-3, a machine learning model developed by OpenAI, I am also developing a website that generates fake product names and subsequent descriptions for those products. Here are a couple example outputs I generated while filling out the application for the Junior to Mid-Level Front End Developer position.
##
  **Product Name:**
  Lite-Touch

  **Short Description:**
  Lite-Touch is a new kind of flat panel display that eliminates the need for a power cord.

  **Long Description:**
   Using groundbreaking technology, Lite-Touch displays are powered by indoor lighting and can be used in any environment. For example, using our patented “LightSwitch”  technology, Lite-Touch displays can be powered by the sun indoors or on a window sill. Plus, they do not require batteries or any other power source! Because there are no cords, you can easily move your board from room to room or even take it outside to use as an all weather display and bulletin board. The bottom line is that there has never been an easier way to display information so inexpensively!
## 
  **Product Name:** 
  Newton

  **Short Description:**
  Never lose your keys again! Newton is a Bluetooth key finder that pairs with your smartphone so you can find your keys from anywhere using the free app.

  **Long Description:**
  When you misplace something, there's no reason to delay for even a second – especially if it's important. The Newton is a Bluetooth key finder that pairs with your iPhone or Android so you can use the free app to find anything you've misplaced in seconds! It has an ultra-precise location system and works even if it is in another room or buried under junk mail! Simply attach the device to any keyring and download the free app – available for both Android and iPhone – on Google Play or Apple's App Store. You'll never have to worry about losing your keys, laptop, or purse again!

These products were generated on the spot and highlight the formidable nature of GPT-3's creative potential. Additionally, this use case provides a glimpse at the future potential of machine learning in areas long seen as inpenetrable by AI. Art, culture, and the overall human experience will be influenced by algorithms with more precision and pervasiveness than currently seen. Though present-day algorithms have a reputation for swaying thoughts and behaviors without consent, and no doubt will in the future, powerful technologies on the order of GPT-3 can be democratized and given to everyone for their own personal persuits. When this era of accessible AI emerges, the playing field will level and the human experience will be rippend for significant progress.

**In Summary**

My long-term goal is to facilitate creativity with technology, and vice versa. As I displayed here, I will bring the originality, insight, and innovation essential for your business solutions and company mission.
