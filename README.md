# GANArt

https://ganart-io.web.app/

This was the first website I developed with React. Since then I have developed a few more websites, but have yet to put the code on GitHub.
The name GANArt comes from the fact that all images on this website were generated with a machine learning algorithm known as a generative adversarial network (GAN).
